MFGAN is a novel CycleGAN-Based network for masked face generation, which is qualified for generating correct, authentic-looking and type-diverse masked face. The above picture shows some sample masked face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset.

## Datasets
### Masked-FFHQ
Masked face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset can be divided into many different categories, and only partial results are shown in the following figure:
