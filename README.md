# MFGAN: A Novel CycleGAN-Based Network for Masked Face Generation
![MFGAN](./MFGAN.png)
MFGAN is a novel CycleGAN-Based network for masked face generation, which is qualified for generating correct, authentic-looking and type-diverse masked face. The above picture shows some sample masked face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset.

## Datasets
### Masked-FFHQ
Masked face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset can be divided into many different categories, and only partial results are shown in the following figure:

MFGAN can generate masked face images of the corresponding style according to the real-world reference masked face images, as shown in following figure:

Then we publish a demo dataset of Masked-FFHQ, which is available to facilitate future research. Download address is as follows:

### Masked-CelebA
We use MFGAN to generate masked face images on a large-scale face dataset, CelebA, and we construct a mask version of CelebA, named Masked-CelebA. Our generation method, MFGAN, can generate authentic-looking masks while preserving the original facial features, as shown in the following figure:

Therefore, the constructed Masked-CelebA dataset can be used for masked face recognition.
Then we publish a demo dataset of Masked-CelebA, which is available to facilitate future research. Download address is as follows:
