# MFGAN: A Novel GAN-Based Network for Masked Face Generation
![MFGAN](./MFGAN.png)
MFGAN is a novel GAN-Based network for masked face generation, which is qualified for generating correct, authentic-looking and diverse masked face.The above picture is some sample masked face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset.

## Datasets
### Masked-FFHQ
Mask face images generated by MFGAN on FFHQ dataset can be divided into many different categories, and only partial results are shown here, as shown in the following figure:

Then we open a demo dataset of Masked-FFHQ, which is only used to display the generating effect of our method, MFGAN.Download address is as follows.

### Masked-CelebA
We use MFGAN to generate masked face images on a large-scale face dataset, CelebA, and we construct a mask version of CelebA, named Masked-CelebA. Our generation method, MFGAN, can generate authentic-looking masks while preserving the original facial features, as shown in the following figure:

Therefore, the Masked-CelebA dataset we constructed can be used for masked face recognition task.
Then we open a demo dataset of Masked-CelebA, which is only used to display the generating effect of our method, MFGAN. Download address is as follows.
